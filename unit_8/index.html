				<h1>Language</h1>
				<p>Lithuanian is the oldest surviving Indo-European language related to Sanscrit, Latin and Ancient Greek. It is one of two living Baltic languages, along with Latvian. Over the centuries, the Lithuanian language has had to struggle against foreign attempts to belittle, supress and annihilate it. In Lithuania Proper, the Lithuanian tongue was undermined by the Polish and Russian languages; in Lithuania Minor by German influence and repression. However, there was considerable opposition to these attempts to undermine and exterminate the Lithuanian language. At first, this opposition was timid and meager, but as early as the second half of the 19th century it overflowed into a strong current which led to the rebirth of the Lithuanian language and nation.
				At all times the strongest support for the Lithuanian language has come from the common people, the Lithuanian rural population. It maintained undamaged the Lithuanian tongue and national spirit.

				<h1>Food</h1>
				<p>Lithuanian cuisine features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Eastern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other Eastern European and Jewish cuisines. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country’s long and difficult history.

			<div class="music">
				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p>Popmusic is more popular one, but mocked by the fans of alternative latter for its lame lyrics, little musical value and recorded performances. Typically the run-off-a-mill bands of pretty blonde girls made famous by various reality TV shows or professional producing companies or, are ones made fun of the most.

				Nevertheless, these ephemeral bands never lasting more than some 6 years are only one side of Lithuania's pop music. On the other side are well-known singers with their decades-spanning careers. Called "estrada singers", the top veteran stars are the late Stasys Povilaitis and Edmundas Kučinskas (both loved by older people).

				There is also a "middle ground" of singers who augment their pop music careers by acting in musicals or performing more serious songs. Arguably the most famous such performer is Marijus Mikutavičius who somehow always manages to unite the nation with his anthems for basketball, hapiness, and other positive things. The divides between followers of various genres sometimes disappear while listening to his "Trys milijonai" song created for 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, but as popular today as it was a decade ago.</p><br>

			<div class="travel">
				<h1>Travel</h1>
				<p>Lithuania is a vibrant and quirky country, which has undergone rapid modernization since becoming independent from the Soviet Union in 1990. You’ll find a lively nightlife, both in Vilnius and on the coast, ample grounds for outdoor pursuits in the as yet unspoiled national parks and a number of good beaches, as well as a stark contrast between city life and rural poverty. Fiercely proud of their country, Lithuanians are more exuberant and welcoming than their Baltic neighbours and you are likely to encounter their hospitality everywhere.</p><br>
